# ðŸ“‹ Ticket 1: Rename Agent Endpoints to Routes

**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Effort:** 0.5 hours

## Description

Rename the existing `agent/app/api/endpoints/` folder to `agent/app/api/routes/` for better naming consistency and update all imports.

## Files to Update

```
agent/app/api/endpoints/ â†’ agent/app/api/routes/ (rename folder)
agent/app/main.py (update imports)
```

## Implementation Details

**Folder Structure Change:**

```bash
# Rename the folder
mv agent/app/api/endpoints agent/app/api/routes
```

**agent/app/main.py** - Update imports:

```python
# Change from:
from app.api.endpoints import chat, health

# To:
from app.api.routes import chat, health
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `endpoints` folder renamed to `routes`

- [x] Existing API routes still functional
