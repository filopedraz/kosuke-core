### Running Locally

```bash
# run the backend
cp .env.example .env
cp ./agent/.env.example ./agent/.env
just run-backend
# install Next.js dependencies
nvm i && bun install
# run the database migrations
bun run db:push
# run the Next.js application
bun run dev
```

### Linting and Pre-commit Hook

To set up the linting pre-commit hook:

```bash
bun install
bun run prepare
```

This configures a Git pre-commit hook that runs linting and prevents commits with issues. To bypass in exceptional cases:

```bash
git commit -m "Your message" --no-verify
```
