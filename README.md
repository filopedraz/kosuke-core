### Running Locally

```bash
# Start all services (Postgres + Next.js)
just run
```

The application will be available at:

- Next.js app: http://localhost:3000
- Postgres: localhost:54323

For pre-commits and IDE linting install the dependencies locally:

```bash
just install
```

**Note**: On first run, you may need to run database migrations. Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
# Run database migrations inside the Next.js container
just migrate
```

## Adding envionrment variables

- Add the variable in `.env.example`
- If it is a `NEXT_PUBLIC` variable add it in `.env.prod.public`
- If it is a server side variable with non-secret value add it in `.env.prod`
- If it is a server side variable with secret value add it in `.env.prod` with the syntax `VARIABLE=${VARIABLE}`. Add the variable in Github kosuke-core repo. Settings > Secrets and Varibles > Actions > New Repository Secret
