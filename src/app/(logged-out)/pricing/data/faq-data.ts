    question: 'How is Kosuke different from Lovable or other AI coding platforms?',
    answer:
      'Unlike pure AI platforms that leave you stuck debugging generated code, Kosuke combines AI speed with human expertise. When AI hits a wall, our senior engineers step in to fix issues and ship production-ready code.',
  },
  {
    id: 'item-2',
    question: 'Why is Kosuke cheaper than a traditional software agency?',
    answer:
      'We leverage AI for the heavy lifting and only use senior engineers where human expertise is critical. This hybrid approach gives you agency-level quality at a fraction of the cost.',
  },
  {
    id: 'item-3',
    question: 'What happens to my code if I stop using Kosuke?',
    answer:
      "Nothing. Your code lives in your own repository from day one. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary frameworks. Export everything and walk away anytime—though we're confident you won't want to.",
  },
  {
    id: 'item-4',
    question: 'How do you avoid the "credit burning" problem of other platforms?',
    answer:
      "We don't charge per API call or compute usage. Our pricing is transparent and predictable. You know exactly what you're paying upfront, with no surprise bills from AI token usage.",
  },
  {
    id: 'item-5',
    question: 'Can I really ship production-quality code with Kosuke?',
    answer:
      "Yes. Every feature goes through senior engineer review before shipping. We don't just generate code—we ensure it's maintainable, scalable, and production-ready.",
  },
