    question: 'How is this different from hiring freelancers or contractors?',
    answer:
      'The initial V1 build is similar to hiring a high-end agency but at a fraction of the cost, thanks to our expertise in leveraging AI efficiently to build new software. ' +
      'Moreover, you get access to the Kosuke platform to eventually build the next features yourself.',

    question: 'Do I own the code? Can I take it elsewhere?',

      'Absolutely. Your code lives in your own repository from day one. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary frameworks. You have complete ownership and can continue development independently at any time.',

    question: 'What happens after the first version is launched?',
    answer:
      'Once the first version is launched, you can choose to build the next features with our vibe coding platform, or keep working with the same engineers. You can also choose to take your repository and leave us. You are never locked in.',
