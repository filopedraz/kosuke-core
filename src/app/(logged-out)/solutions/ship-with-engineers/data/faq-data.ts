    question: 'How is this different from hiring freelancers or contractors?',
    answer:
      'Unlike freelancers who work in isolation, our engineers integrate with your team and take full ownership. You get dedicated senior engineers who understand your product, not just task executors. Plus, we handle vetting, management, and quality control.',
  },

    id: 'item-2',
    question: 'What level of engineers will work on my project?',
    answer:
      'Only senior engineers with 5+ years of production experience. No juniors, no interns. Every engineer has shipped real products and knows how to navigate complex technical decisions.',

    question: 'How quickly can you start working on my project?',

    question: 'Do I own the code? Can I take it elsewhere?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Your code lives in your own repository from day one. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary frameworks. You have complete ownership and can continue development independently at any time.',
  },
  {
    id: 'item-5',
    question: 'How do you ensure code quality and best practices?',
    answer:
      'Every commit goes through peer review by senior engineers. We follow industry-standard practices: comprehensive testing, clean architecture, proper documentation, and scalable patterns. Your codebase will be maintainable long-term.',
  },

    id: 'item-6',
    question: "What if the engineers don't work out for my project?",
    answer:
      "We offer flexible engagement terms. If you're not satisfied, we can switch engineers or pause the engagement. Our goal is to deliver valueâ€”if we're not, we make it right or part ways professionally.",
  },
